# Comparison-between-different-Machine-Learning-models.  

Objective : To use a set of predictors and target on different machine learning models and report the best performing model by comparing the error metrics.

Description : In this we have tested models namely Linear Regression , KNN and Decision Tree Regression on a set of predictors to predict the target and reported the best model after doing a 10 fold cross validation.
